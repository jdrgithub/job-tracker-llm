- The vector database enables semantic search across all your data

### 2. **ChatGPT Integration**
- ChatGPT receives context about your job opportunities
- It can analyze patterns, provide insights, and give recommendations
- The AI understands your specific job search situation

### 3. **Intelligent Features**
- **Semantic Search**: Find opportunities using natural language
- **AI Insights**: Get analysis of your job search progress

## Advanced Usage

### Custom AI Prompts

You can modify the AI prompts in `src/job_tracker_llm/ai_assistant.py` to customize the AI's behavior:

```python
# Example: Modify the system prompt for job search insights
system_prompt = f"""You are an expert job search coach specializing in tech careers. 
Analyze this job search data and provide insights:

{stats_context}

Recent Opportunities:

3. Interest level analysis and recommendations
4. Follow-up strategy suggestions
5. Areas for improvement
6. Next steps to take

Be encouraging but honest. Provide specific, actionable advice."""
```

### Vector Search Customization

Customize the vector search behavior:

```python
# Search with different parameters
results = ai_assistant.vector_store.semantic_search(
    query="software engineer remote",
    k=10,  # Number of results
    filters={"active": True}  # Only active opportunities
)
```

### Batch AI Analysis

Create scripts for batch analysis:

```python
from job_tracker_llm.ai_assistant import JobTrackerAI
from job_tracker_llm.storage import JobStorage
from job_tracker_llm.vector_store import JobVectorStore

# Initialize
storage = JobStorage()
vector_store = JobVectorStore(storage)
ai = JobTrackerAI(storage, vector_store)

# Batch analysis
insights = ai.get_job_search_insights()
print(insights)

# Analyze all active opportunities
active_opps = [opp for opp in storage.list_opportunities() if opp['active']]
for opp in active_opps:
    analysis = ai.analyze_opportunity(opp['company'], opp['role'])
    print(f"\nAnalysis for {opp['company']}:")
    print(analysis)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **OpenAI API Key Not Set**
```
Error: OpenAI client not available. Please set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.
```
**Solution:** Set your API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
```

#### 2. **Vector Database Not Built**
```
Error: Vector store not available. Run build_index() first.
```
**Solution:** Build the vector index:
```bash
python3 scripts/setup_vector_db.py
```

#### 3. **No Opportunities Found**
```
Warning: No job opportunities found to index.
```
**Solution:** Add opportunities first:
```bash
python3 src/job_tracker_llm/simple_cli.py
```

#### 4. **API Rate Limits**
```
Error: Rate limit exceeded.
```
**Solution:** Wait a moment and try again, or upgrade your OpenAI plan.

### Performance Tips

1. **Limit Results**: Use smaller `k` values for faster responses
2. **Cache Responses**: Store AI responses for repeated questions
3. **Batch Operations**: Process multiple opportunities together
4. **Optimize Prompts**: Keep prompts concise for faster responses

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Security**: Never commit your API key to version control
2. **Data Privacy**: Your job data stays local; only summaries are sent to OpenAI
3. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API usage and costs
4. **Data Validation**: Always review AI-generated content before using

## Cost Management

OpenAI API costs depend on:
- **Model used**: GPT-3.5-turbo is cheaper than GPT-4
- **Token usage**: Longer prompts cost more
- **Number of requests**: More interactions = higher costs

**Estimated costs:**
- GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens
- Typical job search analysis: $0.01-0.05 per request
- Monthly usage (10-20 requests): $0.10-1.00

## Next Steps

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic insights and questions
2. **Experiment**: Try different types of questions and prompts
3. **Customize**: Modify prompts to match your specific needs
4. **Integrate**: Use AI insights in your job search strategy
5. **Automate**: Create scripts for regular AI analysis

The AI integration transforms your job tracker from a simple data storage tool into an intelligent career assistant that can provide personalized insights and recommendations based on your actual job search data!
