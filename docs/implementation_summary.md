## Data Structure

Each job opportunity is stored as a JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "company": "Example Corp",
  "role": "Software Engineer",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00",
  "recruiter_name": "John Doe",
  "recruiter_contact": "john@example.com",
  "interest_level": 4,
  "active": true,
  "notes": "Great opportunity",
  "next_steps": "Follow up next week",
  "source": "LinkedIn",
  "interactions": []
}
```
